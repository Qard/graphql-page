# graphql-page

This module is a collection of helpers to compose Connect + ConnectionEdge
style pagination with graphql.

## Install

```sh
npm install graphql-page
```

## Usage

```js
async resolver(root, args) {
  // Build a limited query from first or last directions
  const query = {
    limit: args.first || args.last,
    order: ['id', args.first ? 'ASC' : 'DESC']
  }

  // Use before or after cursors to move the query window
  if (args.after) {
    query.where = {
      id: { gt: page.fromCursor(args.after) }
    }
  } else if (args.before) {
    query.where = {
      id: { lt: page.fromCursor(args.before) }
    }
  }

  // Run the query
  const records = await Record.findAll(query)

  // Check if there's a previous record
  const previous = await Record.findOne({
    where: { id: args.after }
  })
  const hasPreviousPage = !!previous

  // Check if there's a next record
  const last = records[record.length - 1]
  const next = await Record.findOne({
    where: { id: { gt: last.id } }
  })
  const hasNextPage = !!next

  // Make a page object
  return page(records, {
    hasNextPage,
    hasPreviousPage
  })
}
```

## API

### `page(items [, options])`

This produces a page result from an array of records. The `options` object
can contain `hasNextPage` and `hasPreviousPage` fields to indicate if the
consumer should expect more pages.

### `page.pageInfo(item [, options])`

This only creates the pageInfo object. As in `page(items [, options])`,
`options` can include `hasNextPage` and `hasPreviousPage` values.

### `page.toEdge(record)`

Converts a record object to an edge object containing the `cursor` and `node`
properties.

### `page.toCursor(id)`

Converts a string or numeric id to a cursor string.

### `page.fromCursor(cursor)`

Converts a cursor string back to a string id. If your origin id format is
numeric, you'll need to do your own conversion from string back to number.
